[00:13:18] <Thetan`Family> <3
[00:13:27] <Thetan`Family> rawr this is final?
[00:13:30] <Thetan`Family> cool
[00:13:49] <Thetan`Family> :Thetan`Family!Thetan@HTS-EEB48195.dsl.mindspring.com PRIVMSG #bren2010 :rawr this is final?
[00:13:49] <Thetan`Family> ircMsg Object
[00:13:49] <Thetan`Family> (
[00:13:49] <Thetan`Family> [raw:ircMsg:private] =>
[00:13:49] <Thetan`Family> [nick:ircMsg:private] => Thetan`Family
[00:13:49] <Thetan`Family> [name:ircMsg:private] => Thetan

[00:14:05] <Thetan`Family> )
[00:14:07] <Thetan`Family> )
[00:14:12] <Bren2010> what are you working on?
[00:14:20] <Thetan`Family> an irc parser
[00:14:24] <Bren2010> :|
[00:14:49] <Thetan`Family> it works already
[00:15:05] <Thetan`Family> $message = new ircMsg($data);
[00:15:06] <Thetan`Family> thats it
[00:15:24] <Thetan`Family> then to get info from the ircMsg you use the interface
[00:15:29] <Thetan`Family> $message->getNick();
[00:15:37] <Thetan`Family> $message->getCommand();
[00:15:44] <Thetan`Family> $message->getHost();
[00:15:54] <Bren2010> that is fucking tits
[00:15:54] <Thetan`Family> $message->getName();
[00:16:05] <Thetan`Family> $message->getServer();
[00:16:19] <Thetan`Family> $message->getParameters(); // this returns an array of parameters
[00:16:51] <Thetan`Family> so to call the hooks in the loop, you'd do something like:
[00:17:01] <Thetan`Family> $message = new ircMsg($data);
[00:17:15] <Thetan`Family> $modules->hooks($message->getCommand(), $message);
[00:17:32] <Thetan`Family> brb
[00:17:39] <Bren2010> getMessage()?
[00:18:21] <Thetan`Family> you mean the full unparsed message?
[00:18:27] <Thetan`Family> $message->getRaw();
[00:18:30] <Bren2010> no, get the message that was sent
[00:18:39] <Bren2010> i.e. for about: "no, get the message that was sent"
[00:18:43] <Bren2010> above*
[00:19:22] <Thetan`Family> huh?
[00:19:38] <Bren2010> You know, what comes after the ' :'
[00:19:59] <Bren2010> I don't think MODE has one.
[00:20:25] <Thetan`Family> yeah, thats part of parameters
[00:20:32] <Thetan`Family> the parser is per the irc standard
[00:20:49] <Thetan`Family> http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2812.html  << see section 2.3.1
[00:20:57] <Thetan`Family> the BNF explains what each part is
[00:21:17] <Thetan`Family> everything after the command is a parameter
[00:21:28] <Thetan`Family> parameters that begin with : indicate the trailing parameter
[00:21:46] <Thetan`Family> the trailing parameter is to be the last parameter and is to ignore spacing
[00:22:36] <Bren2010> ah, ok I guess :/
[00:22:48] <Bren2010> Anyway, push that so I can work on it.
[00:22:51] <Thetan`Family> ok
[00:22:57] <Thetan`Family> so to get the message part
[00:23:00] <Bren2010> I'm trying to do smart output/recording
[00:23:00] <Thetan`Family> of a privmsg
[00:23:13] <Thetan`Family> $params = $message->getParameters();
[00:23:23] <Thetan`Family> $msg = end($params);
[00:23:33] <Thetan`Family> then $params[0] is the channel
