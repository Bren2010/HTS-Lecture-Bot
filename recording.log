[0:0:18] <Lector> Definition 1: lim x->c f(x) = L means that when x is close to but different from c, then f(x) is near L.
[0:0:28] <Lector> Definition 1: lim x->c f(x) = L means that when x is close to but different from c, then f(x) is near L.
[0:0:34] <Lector> Definition 2: lim x->c+ f(x) = L means that when x is close to but on the right of c (the positive/right side), then f(x) is near L.
[0:0:44] <Lector> Theorem: lim x->c f(x) = L <-> lim x->c- f(x) = L and lim x->c+ f(x) = L. (Why?)
[0:0:58] <Lector> You may now ask questions if you wish.  This may also be considered intermission if the lector is taking a break.
[0:1:4] <Lector> The lecture is now resuming.
